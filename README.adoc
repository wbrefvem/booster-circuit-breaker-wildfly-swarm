= Circuit Breaker - WildFly Swarm Booster

IMPORTANT: This runs best when deployed to OpenShift in order to use the circuit breaker functionality. For more details on using this booster with a single-node OpenShift cluster, CI/CD deployments, as well as the rest of the runtime, see the link:http://appdev.openshift.io/docs/wf-swarm-runtime.html[WildFly Swarm Runtime Guide].

== Run this Booster on a Single-node OpenShift Cluster
If you have a single-node OpenShift cluster, such as Minishift or the Red Hat Container Development Kit, link:http://appdev.openshift.io/docs/minishift-installation.html[installed and running], you can also deploy your booster there. A single-node OpenShift cluster provides you with access to a cloud environment that is similar to a production environment.

To deploy your booster to a running single-node OpenShift cluster:

. Log in and create your project.
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ git clone git@github.com:${loggedUser}/${targetRepository}

$ cd ${targetRepository}

$ oc login -u developer -p developer

$ oc new-project MY_PROJECT_NAME

$ mvn clean fabric8:deploy -Popenshift -DskipTests
----


== Interact with this Booster on a Single-node OpenShift Cluster

To interact with your booster while it's running on a Single-node Openshift Cluster, you first need to obtain it's URL:

[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc get route greeting-service -o jsonpath={$.spec.host}

greeting-service-MY_PROJECT_NAME.192.168.42.158.nip.io

$ oc get route name-service -o jsonpath={$.spec.host}

name-service-MY_PROJECT_NAME.192.168.42.158.nip.io
----


You can use the form at your application's url or you can use the `curl` command:


[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ curl http://greeting-service-MY_PROJECT_NAME.192.168.42.158.nip.io/api/greeting
{"content":"Hello, World!"}

$ curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"state": "fail"}' http://name-service-MY_PROJECT_NAME.192.168.42.158.nip.io/api/state

$ curl http://greeting-service-MY_PROJECT_NAME.192.168.42.158.nip.io/api/greeting
{"content":"Hello, Fallback!"}

$ curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"state": "ok"}' http://name-service-MY_PROJECT_NAME.192.168.42.158.nip.io/api/state

$ curl http://greeting-service-MY_PROJECT_NAME.192.168.42.158.nip.io/api/greeting
{"content":"Hello, World!"}
----

== CI/CD Deployment
As part of the process of creating this booster, launch.openshift.io set up a project with a CI/CD deployment of this booster. You can see the status of this deployment in the link:https://manage.openshift.com[OpenShift Online Web console]. You can also learn more about this booster and rest of the WildFly Swarm runtime in the link:http://appdev.openshift.io/docs/wf-swarm-runtime.html[WildFly Swarm Runtime Guide].
